	abstract = {We use detailed time-diary information on high school students’ daily activities from the 2003–2008 American Time Use Surveys ({ATUS}) to investigate the effects of employment on the time a student spends on homework and other major activities. Time-diary data are more detailed and accurate than data derived from responses to “usual activity” survey questions underlying other analyses and capture the immediate effects of working that may well accumulate over time to affect future outcomes. Our results suggest that employment decreases the time that high school students spend on homework, which is human-capital building, on all days, but also decreases screen time on non-school days, which may be considered unproductive time. Employed teens get more than the recommended amount of sleep on school days, and only slightly less on non-school days.},

	abstract = {Much controversy surrounds the consequences of adolescent paid work, with researchers coming to diverse conclusions about whether work is good, work is bad, work doesn’t matter (the purported effects of employment are spurious, dependent on processes of selection), and work matters for some youth but not others, depending on their prior backgrounds and attributes and the contexts of their employment. This article summarizes findings from the Youth Development Study, a long-term, ongoing longitudinal study that has followed a community-based panel from middle adolescence through early adulthood. The findings address this debate and support the final perspective—that the effects of teen employment on the successful transition to adulthood depend on its patterning through the years of high school (most invested, steady, sporadic, and occasional employment patterns) and its quality. Moreover, the {YDS} shows that patterns of teenage employment are linked to the social origins and motivations of youth upon entry to high school, and suggest that teenagers exercise agency as they build human capital during high school through education and work experience. The article concludes with a discussion of what parents, counselors, and others can do to help children make sound employment-related decisions during adolescence so as to assure effective career exploration and a successful school-to-work transition.},

	abstract = {{AbstractPurpose}
To explore potential risk factors for acute and chronic work-related fatigue in students working at a paid job while pursuing school studies. Although work-related fatigue was identified as a potential hazard for youth health, academic achievement, and occupational safety, very few studies have specifically addressed its correlates and possible predictors.
Methods
Cross-sectional data from an ongoing prospective cohort study of health risk behaviors in adolescents was used to identify factors associated with increased levels of acute and chronic fatigue in 209 students aged 17–18 years working during the school year. Multiple stepwise regression analyses were performed with acute and chronic fatigue levels as dependent variables, and demographic, work, and health factors as potential explanatory variables.
Results
Average hours worked per week by students was 14.7 hours. It was observed that higher psychological distress, poorer health perception, greater sleep debt, and higher exposure to physical work factors were associated with higher levels of acute fatigue. Also, it was observed that higher psychological distress, poorer health perception, higher exposure to physical work factors, and holding multiple jobs were associated with higher levels of chronic fatigue. The number of hours worked weekly was associated with neither acute nor chronic work-related fatigue.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that prevention strategies devised to minimize work-related fatigue in students should consider exposure to physical work factors. Results also re-emphasize the importance of obtaining sufficient sleep so as to prevent high levels of acute work-related fatigue.},

	abstract = {Teenagers working more than 20 hours per week perform worse in school than youth who work less. There are two competing explanations for this association: (1) that paid work takes time and effort away from activities that promote achievement, such as completing homework, preparing for examinations, getting help from parents and teachers, and participating in extracurricular activities, and (2) that the relationship between paid work and school performance is spurious, reflecting preexisting differences between students in academic ability, motivation, and school commitment. Using longitudinal data from the ongoing national Monitoring the Future project, this research examines the impact of teenage employment on school performance and academic engagement during the 8th, 10th, and 12th grades. The authors address issues of spuriousness by using a two-level hierarchical model to estimate the relationships of within-individual changes in paid work to changes in school performance and other school-related measures. Unlike in prior research, the authors compare youth school performance and academic orientation when they are actually working in high-intensity jobs to when they are jobless and wish to work intensively. Results indicate that the mere wish for intensive work corresponds with academic difficulties in a manner similar to actual intensive work.},
